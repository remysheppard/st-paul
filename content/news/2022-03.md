As I was looking at things regarding traditions around giving things up for Lent, I came across this article. Written by Rev. David Peterson from Ft. Wayne, IN, it was originally published in Lutheran Witness. As we enter into this new season of the church year, I share it with you here:

> Giving up some small pleasure for Lent, like chocolate or coffee, can be a nice way to remind ourselves throughout Lent that it is Lent. When we reach out for those things we remember that we are denying ourselves in commemoration of Our Lord’s suffering.
  This isn’t meant to please God or gain His favor. Nor can such a small denial make Lent more meaningful or increase faith. It is simply an attempt to keep ourselves mindful throughout the day that it is Lent. That is a valid Christian desire and discipline. 

Curbing the flesh is always good. Cutting calories is probably appropriate for almost everyone reading this, and (though I hate to admit it) cutting caffeine would probably hurt few of us either.

But Lent isn’t ultimately about giving things up. Its purpose is not self-improvement in the conventional sense. Instead Lent is a season of preparation. We are preparing to celebrate Easter and the Church is always prepared in the same way: by repentance.

True repentance is not simply feeling sorry, and it certainly isn’t an emotional frenzy of despair. Nor is it merely an outward discipline for the world to see. True repentance means turning away from sin in sorrow and also turning toward God in joy. That is to say, that true repentance is faith. 

It expects forgiveness. It trusts in Christ to give it. Judas was not truly repentant (Matthew 27:3-5). He was only remorseful. He did not think he could be forgiven. He did not trust Jesus to love him. In contrast, St. Peter was repentant (Mark 14:66-72). He was more than remorseful. He was sorry for his sins and ashamed of what he had done, but even more than this, he trusted in Christ to be merciful.

Lent is therefore not so much a time of "giving things up" as it is a time for adding things that increase our awareness of God’s mercy in Christ Jesus. When Lent leads us to repentance, it isn’t to make us sad or to somehow get God’s attention. It is to strengthen our faith. Part of that strengthening includes an increased awareness of our great need — and yes, that often means a stern preaching of the Law. 

But that is not the real mark or purpose of Lent. For Lent also includes, and is mostly focused on, the solution to that need: the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for our redemption. Nearly all of our churches will add midweek services during Lent and also Holy Week services, not for the primary purpose of preaching the Law but rather that we might have more opportunities to receive God’s forgiveness, hear His Word and receive His Sacrament.

So if you’re looking for something to give up this Lent, I suggest you give up a few hours each
Wednesday evening and go to Church. Don’t do it to make yourself sad. Do it for the joy of hearing
God’s Word and receiving His gifts. There, by the means of Grace, repentance is educated and edified
and faith is fed. That is what Lent is meant for.

**Change in service times** — The governor lifted the mask mandate February 28 so Lenten services will be at 7; and on Sundays, Bible Study and Sunday School will be at 9 and worship will be at 10 AM.

Stacey Shrewsbury will be stepping down as Sunday School Superintendent at the end of the school year. This position is responsible for the Sunday School program (provide curriculum, track attendance, recruit teachers), directs the Children's Christmas service, and organizes Easter Egg Hunt. Also, the Sunday School Superintendent meets quarterly with other members of the Church Council. As we have all had to think of ways to do things a bit different with COVID, this position requires creativity, enthusiasm, and desire to serve the youth of the congregation. If interested in this position, or would like more information, contact Stacey Shrewsbury (815-674-5324), or Pastor Latzke.

**Shrove Tuesday** was held March 1 with over forty people in attendance. There were games for the children and a trivia game for adults. The food was delicious and the free will offering will help with expenses for the youth attending the Youth Gathering in Houston this summer. A game of cards was also on hand for those who wanted. Our thanks to Liz Easley and her helpers for the fun evening.

The next book club will be meeting Thursday, March 10th 6:30 at the church. We will be reading Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Olive is a retired school teacher living in the small town of Crosby Maine, and the 13 short stories comprising the book intertwine Olive. Who says you have to like the main character. Or do you?

If you have any questions, contact Liz Easley.
