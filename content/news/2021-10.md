### Fresh Fruit and Type 2 Diabetes

A new study reveals that eating two servings of fresh fruit each day could lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 36%.

Researchers from Edith Cowan University, Australia, analyzed the diets of 7,675 people for more than five years and found that those who ate at least two servings of fruit per day had higher measures of insulin sensitivity. That means their bodies could better control their blood sugar levels – by producing less insulin to lower their blood glucose levels – than those who consumed less than half a serving a day.

Fruit juice did not produce the same results. In fact, researchers found no association between fruit juice intake and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. That’s due to fruit juices being higher in sugar and lower in fiber. Unlike juice, most fruits typically have a low glycemic index, which means the fruit’s sugar is digested and absorbed into the body more slowly.

This recent study further points to the importance of adding fruit to your diet. Not only can fruits reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but they also provide important vitamins, minerals and fiber.
