summary:  Celebrating Mother’s Day is all about celebrating the spirit of motherhood. Let's celebrate together!

Mothers are angels sent by God. They love us unconditionally and they make many sacrifices all their lives to keep us happy and ensure our comfort. Celebrating Mother’s Day is all about celebrating the spirit of motherhood. This day falls on the second Sunday in the month of May. Surprise your mother by sending spiritual Mother’s Day blessings.

We celebrate Mother’s Day to honor the accomplishments of the women in our life. It’s also a time to cherish the relationship between child and mother. But who created the American tradition of Mother’s Day?  It seems like a regular calendar event, but Mother’s Day only recently became a recognized and practiced tradition around the globe. (And no, it wasn’t created by Hallmark.)

Mother’s Day recognizes women for all they do. And unsurprisingly, it took some inspiring women to bring this holiday to the world. 

## The History of Mother’s Day                           

The origins of a motherhood celebration can be traced back to Ancient Greece and Rome, where festivals were held in honor of their mother goddesses, Rhea and Cybele. Much later, in the 16th century, Mothering Sunday was recognized during the fourth Sunday of Lent for parishes of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. This holiday was less about mothers and more about attending your "mother church," meaning the local Christian church. 

But the history of Mother’s Day as we know it came from humble origins in West Virginia, USA. 

During the American Civil War, Ann Reeves Jarvis, known as "Mother Jarvis" in her local parish, helped start "Mother’s Day Work Clubs" to raise awareness of the poor health conditions in her community. These clubs proved to be an excellent unifying force for a region that was very socially divided during the Civil War. After the war ended, Jarvis organized "Mother’s Friendship Day" to promote reconciliation between the Union and Confederacy.

The United States in the late 19th century saw a lot of different movements to organize a Mother’s Day, including from Julia Ward Howe, an abolitionist and suffragist, who wrote the "Mother’s Day Proclamation." This called for mothers to unite and promote world peace.

### Who Created the American Tradition of Mother’s Day?

The day we now recognize as Mother’s Day came from the efforts of Ann Jarvis’s daughter, Anna. Anna saw how valiantly her mother expressed activism to give mothers the recognition they deserve. She made it her life mission to get Mother’s Day onto the national calendar, and in 1908, she sparked the first widely recognized celebration of the holiday while she held a public memorial for her mother in Grafton, West Virginia. 

Anna’s campaign continued to gain popularity over the years, as she teamed up with floral companies and department stores to spread the word. By 1912, Mother’s Day had spread to Puerto Rico, Mexico, Canada, and 45 US states (many of which adopted Mother’s Day as an annual holiday).

Finally, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Mother’s Day a national holiday to be celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May.

### When Did Mother’s Day Start?

The end of World War I was when Mother’s Day started to gain popularity, and it took some time for it to become a widely recognized holiday as it is today. Since it was largely seen as an American holiday, other countries were slow to adopt the tradition. 

Many countries, like France and Germany, had very low birth rates after all the men were fighting overseas and women were working labor intensive jobs. These countries, and those in similar situations, started campaigns as a way to encourage motherhood and childbearing. France even gave awards to mothers of large families during this time, and mayors throughout France continue the tradition of awarding the Médaille de la Famille. Over time, Mother’s Day in these countries turned into a celebration of all mothers—not just the ones who were having a lot of children.
